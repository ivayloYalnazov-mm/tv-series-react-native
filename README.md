# Setting up notes

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Install project dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

```bash
yarn  start
```

## Step 3: Start your Application

```bash
yarn  android
```

# Time Constraints

The main goals of the task were fairly easy to setup and implement.
However, things started going out of hand fairly fast because I started adding additional functionalities and playing around too much with configurations. But I insisted on doing them because I though of them as essential. It is important to me to take my time when setting up a new project to research on the current best practices and trends.
The time constraint was fair. It was my mistake diving too deep instead of focusing on the main tasks.
It serves as a valuable lesson to put emphasis on aligning project ambitions with time constraints, ensuring that I meet the requested goals on time.

# Future Enhancements with Additional Time

1.  **Enhanced Testing:** Priority would be given to substantially improving the testing framework. This would include creating and refining tests. Implementing end-to-end tests, to ensure the application's robustness and reliability, is a good option.
2.  **Best Practices Research:** I would dedicate time to researching and implementing additional best practices, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

3.  **Breaking down components:** Breaking down Screens into smaller more manageable component which are easier to test and maintain. Extracting small reusable functions.
4.  **Navigation and Axios Setup:** Further refinement of the application's navigation. Better axios setup to improve development process.
5.  **Project Setup and Configurations:** A thorough reevaluation of the project's setup and configurations to optimize the dev environment and workflow.
6.  **New Functionalities:** The addition of new features, such as the ability to explore/view the cast of shows and detailed episode screens,.
7.  **Offline Experience:** Enhancements to offline functionalities to ensure the application remains functional and engaging, even without internet connectivity.
8.  **Thematic Customization:** Expansion and refinement of the app's theme, including more app-specific settings and a light mode.

In summary, with more time, I would not only focus on augmenting the application with additional features but also on reinforcing its foundation through best practices and testing.
